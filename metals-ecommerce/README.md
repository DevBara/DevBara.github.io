## This site was built for users to purchase precious metals. Gold & silver is not out of reach with PM Exchange!

## Target users 
 Those individuals interested in purchase gold,silver,platinum, etc

## APIs Used
* News API
* GoldBroker
* SpringBoot API
* FinnHub(Stock Ticker)

## Installation/Installs:
* Bootstrap/React-Strap
* react-router-dom
* react-slideshow-image
* axios

## Unsolved Problems 
 * HTTP Put Method works while using postman, but working on live site was a fail
 * HTTP Delete Method works if you input individual id number vs ${id}
 * When adding to cart, needed more time creating the cart component which would be a child to the Product Lists
 * APIs with JSON data in an object(NO ARRAY), would not render on screen.  
    - Object.values?
    - Turn object into an Array?
* Completing admin page, technically users would not be allowed to add,edit,delete data
